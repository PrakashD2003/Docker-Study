## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### Docker Learning Notes
The [README.md](https://github.com/PrakashD2003/Docker-Study/blob/main/README.md) file serves as a **comprehensive study guide** on Docker basics, commands, and workflows.

### Nginx Website Example
1. The [Dockerfile](https://github.com/PrakashD2003/Docker-Study/blob/main/nginx-docker-website/Dockerfile) uses the **Nginx base image**.  
2. It copies the static website from the `website/` folder into the Nginx HTML directory.  
3. Builds a container that runs a lightweight Nginx server.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Project

### 1. Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PrakashD2003/Docker-Study.git
cd Docker-Study/nginx-docker-website
````

### 2. Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t docker-study-nginx .
```

### 3. Run the Container

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 docker-study-nginx
```

Now open **[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)** in your browser to view the sample website.

## üìä Key Learnings

* Writing a **Dockerfile**
* Building and running Docker images
* Understanding container networking (`-p 8080:80`)
* Using Docker to serve static files via **Nginx**

---

## üîÆ Future Improvements

* Add examples for **multi-stage builds**
* Show how to use **Docker Compose** for multi-container setups
* Expand examples with **volumes** and **environment variables**
