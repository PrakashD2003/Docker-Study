## 🐳 What is Docker?
Docker is an **open-source platform** for building, shipping, and running applications in lightweight **containers**.  
A container is like a 📦 that includes:
- Your app
- Dependencies (Python, Node.js, libraries, etc.)
- OS-level files

**Why Docker?**  
Solve the _"It works on my machine"_ problem! Containers run identically on any system with Docker.

## 🚫 The Problem Before Docker
| **Scenario**                     | **Docker Solution**                |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Works on one system but not another | Containers run the same everywhere |
| Manual dependency setup          | Automated via Dockerfile           |
| Conflicts between apps           | Isolated containers                |

---

## ✅ Key Benefits of Docker
- **Consistency**: Same environment everywhere (dev/test/prod)
- **Portability**: Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and cloud
- **Speed**: Containers start in seconds
- **Isolation**: No dependency conflicts
- **Simplified DevOps**: Integrates with CI/CD, Kubernetes, etc.

## 🔧 Core Concepts

| **Concept**       | **Description**                                      |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Image**          | Blueprint for containers (e.g., `nginx:alpine`)      |
| **Container**      | Running instance of an image                         |
| **Dockerfile**     | Recipe to build images                               |
| **Volume**         | Persistent storage for containers                    |
| **Port Mapping**   | Expose container ports to the host (e.g., `-p 80:80`)|

## 🛠️ Installation

### 🪟 Windows/macOS
1. Download [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2. Run the installer
3. Test:  
```bash
docker run hello-world
```

### 🐧 Ubuntu/Linux
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

---

## 🚀 Essential Docker Commands

### Images
```bash
docker pull nginx          # Download image
docker images             # List images
docker rmi <image-id>     # Remove image
```

### Containers
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx   # Run container
docker ps                        # List running containers
docker stop <container-id>       # Stop container
docker exec -it <id> bash        # Enter container
```

### Build & Deploy
```bash
docker build -t myapp .          # Build from Dockerfile
docker-compose up                # Start multi-container app
```

---

## 🧪 Real-World Examples

### Create a Website with Nginx
1. Create `Dockerfile`:
```dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY website/ /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
```

2. Build and run:
```bash
docker build -t my-website .
docker run -d -p 8080:80 my-website
```
Visit `http://localhost:8080` 🚀

## 🧠 Advanced Topics

### Docker Networking
```bash
docker network create my-net          # Create network
docker run --network my-net nginx    # Attach to network
```

### Volumes
```bash
# Persist data
docker run -v /host/path:/container/path nginx

# Create Docker-managed volume
docker volume create mydata
```

### Multi-Stage Builds
```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:18 as builder
RUN npm build

# Final stage
FROM node:18-slim
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
```

### Docker Compose
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: "3"
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"
```

## Docker Engine
The core Docker technology consists of:
- **Docker Daemon**: Manages containers/images
- **REST API**: Communicates with the daemon
- **CLI**: Command-line interface
